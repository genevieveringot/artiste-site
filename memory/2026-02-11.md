## Work Done Today

### Logo Management
- Created `global/logo` section in page_sections table to store logos
- Logo fields: `logo_main` (for dark backgrounds - nav/footer), `logo_light` (optional, for light backgrounds)
- All pages now load logos from this section via `custom_data`
- Admin Settings page updated to manage logos

### Admin Visual Editor Improvements
- Mobile: When clicking a section, shows ONLY the editor (not the list) with "← Retour" button
- Desktop: Shows both list and editor side by side
- Added scroll-to-section feature: clicking a section scrolls the preview iframe to that section
- Added `id="section-{key}"` to all sections on public pages (hero, about, featured, awards, shop, newsletter, gallery, faq, info, form)
- Added useEffect to scroll to hash on page load

### Navigation Styling
- Increased padding: `pt-8 pb-6` (was py-4)
- Logo size: `h-16 md:h-24` (adjusted several times per Geneviève's feedback)

## Technical Notes

### Logo Storage
Logos are stored in `page_sections` table:
- page_name: 'global'
- section_key: 'logo'
- custom_data: { logo_main: "url", logo_light: "url" }

### Pages Updated for Logo/Section IDs
- app/page.tsx (home)
- app/galerie/page.tsx
- app/contact/page.tsx
- app/boutique/page.tsx
- app/expositions/page.tsx
- app/calendrier/page.tsx
- components/Footer.tsx

## Geneviève's Preferences
- Wants immediate visual feedback when editing
- Prefers mobile-first editing experience
- Logo should show the "point du J" (dot above J in signature)
